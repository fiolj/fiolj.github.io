<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Define chemical reactions to perform in the gas phase when
particle-particle collisions occur. See the
<a class="reference external" href="surf_react.html">surf_react</a> command for specification of surface
chemistry reactions.</p>
<p>The <em>none</em> style means that no chemistry will be performed, which is the
default.</p>
<p>For other styles, a file is specified which contains a list of chemical
reactions, with their associated parameters. The reactions are read into
SPARTA and stored in a list. Each time a simulation is run via the
<a class="reference external" href="run.html">run</a> command, the list is scanned. Only reactions for
which all the reactants and all the products are currently defined as
species-IDs will be active for the simulation. Thus the file can contain
more reactions than are used in a particular simulation. See the
<a class="reference external" href="species.html">species</a> command for how species IDs are defined.</p>
<p>The reaction models for the various styles are described below. When a
pair of particles collide, the list of all reactions with those two
species as reactants is looped over. A probability for each reaction is
calculated, using the formulas discussed below, and a random number is
used to decide which reaction (if any) takes place. No check is made
that the sum of probabilities for all possible reactions is &lt;= 1.0, but
that should normally be the case if reasonable reaction coefficients are
defined.</p>
<p>The format of the reaction file is the same for all three of the
currently defined styles, and is also described below. The various
styles interpret and compute the specified reactions in different ways.
The data directory in the SPARTA distribution contains reaction files
for these reaction models, all with the suffix “.tce”.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The <em>tce</em> style is Bird’s Total Collision Energy (TCE) model. When this
style is specified, all computed reactions will use the TCE model.</p>
<p>Using kinetic theory, the TCE model allows for reaction probabilities to
be defined based on known, measured, reaction rates. The model is
described in detail in <a class="reference internal" href="surf_collide.html#bird94" id="id1"><span>[Bird94]</span></a>; see chapter 6. The
required input parameters for each reaction (discussed below) are values
that permit its effective Arrhenius rate to be calculated, namely</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[K(T)  =  A T^b e^{-E_a/kT }\]</div>
<p>where K(T) is the forward reaction rate, T is the temperature of the
participating molecules which is a function of their velocities and
internal energy states, k the Boltzmann constant, and A,b,Ea are input
parameters as discussed below.</p>
<p>All 5 reactions coefficients read from the reaction file (described
below) are used to calculate terms in equation 6.10 of
<a class="reference internal" href="surf_collide.html#bird94" id="id2"><span>[Bird94]</span></a> for the probability that a reaction takes place.</p>
<p>The C2, C3, C4 values are the Arrhenius activation energy Ea, prefactor
A, and exponent b, used in the rate formula above.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The <em>qk</em> style is Bird’s Quantum-Kinetic model (QK). When this style is
specified, all computed reactions will use the QK model.</p>
<p>The QK model implemented is that of <a class="reference internal" href="#bird09" id="id3"><span>[Bird09]</span></a> as validated
<a class="reference internal" href="#gallis09" id="id4"><span>[Gallis09]</span></a> and modified <a class="reference internal" href="#gallis10" id="id5"><span>[Gallis10]</span></a>.</p>
<p>The QK model depends solely on properties of the colliding molecules and
unlike the TCE model makes no use of measured reaction rates or
adjustable parameters. The macroscopic properties used in the QK model
are the available collision energy, activation energies, and quantized
vibrational energy levels.</p>
<p>According to the QK model dissociation reactions take place when the
maximum obtainable vibrational energy after an inelastic energy exchange
is higher than the dissociation level <a class="reference internal" href="#bird09" id="id6"><span>[Bird09]</span></a>.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[int [E_c/(k \Theta_v)] &gt; \Theta_d / \Theta_v\]</div>
<p>Exchange reactions take place when the vibrational energy after a trial
energy exchange is above the activation energy of the exchange reaction
<a class="reference internal" href="#gallis10" id="id7"><span>[Gallis10]</span></a>.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[i_v &gt; int[E_a/ (k \Theta_v)]\]</div>
<p>A new version of the QK model for exchange reactions has been proposed
by <a class="reference internal" href="#bird11" id="id8"><span>[Bird11]</span></a>. This will be implemented in future releases
of SPARTA.</p>
<p>For the QK model, SPARTA reads the same 5 coefficients per reaction from
the reaction file (described below) as for the TCE model. Three of the
coefficients (C1,C2,C5) are used to calculate terms in equation 6.10 of
<a class="reference internal" href="surf_collide.html#bird94" id="id9"><span>[Bird94]</span></a> for the probability that a reaction takes place.
The Arrhenius rate parameters C3 and C4 are ignored by the QK model.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The <em>tce/qk</em> style is a hybrid model which can be used to compute
reactions using both the TCE and QK models. When this style is
specified, reactions from the input file that are flagged with an A =
Arrhenius style will be computed using the TCE model. Reactions from the
input file that are flagged with a Q = Quantum style will be computed
using the QK model.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The format of the input reaction file is as follows. Comments or blank
lines are allowed in the file. Comment lines start with a “#” character.
All other entries must come in 2-line pairs with values separated by
whitespace in the following format</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">R1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">R2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="n">P1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">P2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">...</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction. R1, R2,
etc are one or more reactants, listed as <a class="reference external" href="species.html">species</a> IDs.
P1, P2, etc are one or more products, also listed as
<a class="reference external" href="species.html">species</a> IDs. The number of allowed reactants and
products depends on the reaction type, as discussed below. In most cases
there is no restriction on the order or listed reactants or products on
what species are listed. Exceptions are detailed below. Note that
individual reactants and products must be separated by whitespace and a
“+” sign. The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be
separated by whitespace and “–&gt;”.</p>
<p>The <em>type</em> of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower case)
with the following meaning. The type determines how many reactants and
products can be specified in the first line.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A dissociation reaction means that R1 dissociates into P1 and P2 when it
collides with R2. R2 is preserved in the collision, so P3 = R2 is
required.</p>
<p>An exchange reaction is a collision between R1 and R2 that results in
new products P1 and P2. There is no restriction on the species involved
in the reaction.</p>
<p>An ionization reaction with 2 products is typically a collision between
R1 and R2 that results in a positively charged ion and an election.
However, SPARTA does not check for this, so there is no restriction on
the species involved in the reaction.</p>
<p>An ionization reaction with 3 products is typically a collision between
a neutral R1 and an electon R2 which ejects an electron from the neutral
species, resulting in P1 and P2. Again, SPARTA does not check for this,
so there is no restriction on the species involved in the reaction. R2
is preserved in the collision, so P3 = R2 is required.</p>
<p>A recombination reaction is a collision between R1 and R2 that results
in P1. There is no restriction on the species involved in the reaction.</p>
<p>Note that recombination reactions actually involve a 3rd particle whose
species is not altered by the reaction but whose velocity is, in order
to balance energy and momentum. So conceptually it can be thought of as
both a reactant and a product. There are 3 ways you can specify
recombination reactions, to include information about which species of
3rd particles are eligible to participate:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">R1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">R2</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">P1</span>
<span class="n">R1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">R2</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">P1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">atom</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">mol</span>
<span class="n">R1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">R2</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">P1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">P2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the first case, no info for a 3rd particle is listed. This means any
species of 3rd particle can be used. In the second case, a non-species
keyword is used, either “atom” or “mol”. This means the 3rd particle
must be either an atomic species, or a molecular species. This is based
on the vibrational degrees of freedom listed in the <a class="reference external" href="species.html">species
file</a>. A non-zero DOF is molecular; zero DOF is atomic.
In the third case, a specific species P2 is listed. This means the 3rd
particle must be that species.</p>
<p>Note that for the same R1 and R2, multiple recombination reactions can
be listed in the reaction file. When two particles R1 and R2 are
selected for collision and a possible reaction, if any recombination
reaction is defined for R1 and R2, then a 3rd particle in the same grid
cell is randomly selected. Its species P2 is used to match at most one
of the possibly multiple recombination reactions for R1 and R2. Only
that recombination reaction is checked for a reaction as a possible
outcome of the collision.</p>
<p>This matching is done from most-specific to least-specific, i.e. the
reverse ordering of the 3 cases above. If there is a defined reaction
that lists P2 (third case, most specific), it is used. If not, and there
is a defined reaction for “atom” or “mol” that corresponds to P2 (second
case, intermediate specificity), then it is used. If not, and there is a
defined reaction with no P2 (first case, least specific), then it is
used. If none of these matches occur, no recombination reaction is
possible for that collision between R1 and R2. Note that these matching
rules means that for the same R1 and R2, you can list two reactions, one
with P2 = “atom”, and one with P2 = “mol”. And/or you can list multiple
reactions of the third kind, each with a unique P2.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the ambipolar approximation is being used, via the
<a class="reference external" href="fix_ambipolar.hmtl">fix ambipolar</a> and <a class="reference external" href="collide_modify.html">collide_modify ambipolar
yes</a> commands, then reactions which involve
either ambipolar ions or the ambipolar electron have more restricitve
rules about the ordering of reactants and products. See the next section
for a discussion of these requirements.</p>
<p>The <em>style</em> of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower case)
with the following meaning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A = Arrhenius</p></li>
<li><p>Q = Quantum</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The style determines how many reaction coefficients are listed as C1,
C2, etc, and how they are interpreted by SPARTA.</p>
<p>For both the A = Arrhenius style and Q = Quantum style, there are 5
coefficients:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>C1 = number of internal degrees of freedom (as defined by the TCE
model)</p></li>
<li><p>C2 = Arrhenius activation energy Ea</p></li>
<li><p>C3 = Arrhenius prefactor A</p></li>
<li><p>C4 = Arrhenius exponent b</p></li>
<li><p>C5 = overall reaction energy (positive for exothermic)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The different reaction styles use these values in different ways, as
explained above.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If the ambipolar approximation is being used, via the <a class="reference external" href="fix_ambipolar.html">fix
ambipolar</a> command, then reactions which involve
either ambipolar ions or the ambipolar electron have more restricitve
rules about the ordering of reactants and products, than those described
in the preceeding section.</p>
<p>Note that ambipolar collisions are turned on via the <a class="reference external" href="collide_modify.html">collide_modify
ambipolar yes</a> commands, which in turn requries
that the <a class="reference external" href="fix_ambipolar.hmtl">fix ambipolar</a> is defined in your input
script. This fix defines a particular species as an ambipolar electron,
written as “e” in the reactions that follow. It also defines a list of
ambipolar ions, which are written as species with a trailing “+” sign in
the rules that follow. Other written species (without “+”) can be any
non-ambipolar species.</p>
<p>These rules only apply to reactions that involve ambipolar species (ions
or electrons) as a reactant or product.</p>
<p>Ambipolar dissociation reactions must list their reactants and products
in one of the following orders:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">AB</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">B</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Ambipolar ionization reactions with 2 or 3 products must be in one of

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Styles with a <em>kk</em> suffix are functionally the same as the corresponding
style without the suffix. They have been optimized to run faster,
depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the <a class="reference external" href="Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating
SPARTA</a> section of the manual. The
accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the same
results, except for different random number, round-off and precision
issues.</p>
<p>These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package. See the <a class="reference external" href="Section_start.html#start_3">Making
SPARTA</a> section for more info.</p>
<p>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <a class="reference external" href="Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</a> when you invoke SPARTA, or you
can use the <a class="reference external" href="suffix.html">suffix</a> command in your input script.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</a> section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.</p>
