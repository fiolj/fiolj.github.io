<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Read the geometry of a surface from the specified file. In SPARTA, a
âsurfaceâ is a collection of surface elements that represent the
surface(s) of one or more physical objects which will be embedded in the
global simulation box. Surfaces can be explicit or implicit. This
command reads explicit surfaces from a file containing a list of
explicit surfaces. See the <a class="reference external" href="read_isurf.html">read_isurf</a> command to
read implicit surfaces from a different kind of file. See the <a class="reference external" href="Section_howto.html#howto_13">Howto
6.13</a> section of the manual for an
explantion of explicit versus implicit surfaces as well as distributed
versus non-distributed storage. You cannot mix explicit and implicit
surfaces in the same simulation.</p>
<p>Surface elements are triangles in 3d or line segments in 2d. Surface
elements for each physical object are required to be a complete,
connected set that tile the entire surface of the object. See the
discussion of watertight objects below.</p>
<p>Particles collide with surface elements as they advect. Each surface
element is assigned to a collision model, specified by the
<a class="reference external" href="surf_collide.html">surf_collide</a> command which affects how a
particle bounces off the surface. Each surface element can optionally be
assigned to a reaction model, specified by the
<a class="reference external" href="surf_react.html">surf_react</a> command which determines if any surface
chemistry occurs during a collision. Statistics for each surface element
due to their interactions with particles can be tallied via the <a class="reference external" href="compute_surf.html">compute
surf</a> command, time-averaged via the <a class="reference external" href="fix_ave_surf.html">fix
ave/surf</a> command, and ouput via the <a class="reference external" href="dump.html">dump
surface</a> command.</p>
<p>Surface elememts can be assigned to surface groups via the <a class="reference external" href="group.html">group
surf</a> command. Surface group IDs are used by other
commands to operate on selected sets of elements. This command has
<em>group</em> and <em>typeadd</em> keywords which can be used to help assign
different elements or different objects to different groups.</p>
<p>Explicit surface elements can be stored in a distributed fashion (each
processor only stores elements which overlap grid cells it owns or has a
ghost cell copy of). Or each processor can store a copy of all surface
elements (the default). See the <a class="reference external" href="global.html">global surfs</a> command
to change this setting.</p>
<p>Note that the read_surf command can be used multiple times to read
multiple objects from multiple files and add them to the simulation
domain. The format of a surface file for explicit elements is discussed
below. Optional keywords allow the vertices in the file to be
translated, scaled, and rotated in various ways. This allows a single
surface file, e.g. containing a unit sphere, to be used multiple times
in a single simulation or in different simulations.</p>
<p>The tools directory contains tools that can create surface files with
simple geometric objects (spheres, blocks, etc). It also has tools that
can convert surface files in other formats to the SPARTA format for
explicit surfaces, e.g. for files created by a mesh-generation program.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If all the surface elements are contained in a single file, the
specified file can be a text file or a gzipped text file (detected by a
.gz suffix).</p>
<p>If a â%â character appears in the surface filename, SPARTA expects a set
of multiple files to exist. The <a class="reference external" href="write_surf.html">write_surf</a> command
explains how such sets are created. Read_surf will first read a filename
where â%â is replaced by âbaseâ. This file tells SPARTA how many total
surfaces and files are in the set (i.e. just the header information
described below). The read_surf command then reads the additional files.
For example, if the surface file was specified as save.% when it was
written, then read_surf reads the files save.base, save.0, save.1, â¦
save.P-1, where P is the number of processors that created the surface
file.</p>
<p>Note that P could be the total number of processors in the previous
simulation, or some subset of those processors, if the <em>fileper</em> or
<em>nfile</em> options were used when the surface file was written; see the
<a class="reference external" href="write_surf.html">write_surf</a> command for details. The processors in
the current SPARTA simulation share the work of reading these files;
each reads a roughly equal subset of the files. The number of processors
which created the set can be different than the number of processors in
the current SPARTA simulation. This can be a fast mode of input on
parallel machines that support parallel I/O.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes the format of a single surface
file, whether it is the only file or one of multiple files flagged with
a processor number.</p>
<p>A surface file for explicit surfaces has a header and a body. The header
appears first. The first line of the header is always skipped; it
typically contains a description of the file. Then lines are read one at
a time. Lines can have a trailing comment starting with â#â that is
ignored. If the line is blank (only whitespace after comment is
deleted), it is skipped. If the line contains a header keyword, the
corresponding value is read from the line. If it doesnât contain a
header keyword, the line begins the body of the file.</p>
<p>The body of the file contains one or more sections. The first line of a
section has only a keyword. The next line is skipped. The remaining
lines of the section contain values. The number of lines in a section
depends on the section keyword as described below. Zero or more blank
lines can be used between sections. Sections can appear in any order.</p>
<p>The formatting of individual lines in the surface file (indentation,
spacing between words and numbers) is not important except that header
and section keywords must be capitalized as shown and canât have extra
white space between their words.</p>
<p>These are the recognized header keywords. Header lines can come in any
order. The value(s) are read from the beginning of the line. Thus the
keyword <em>points</em> should be in a line like â1000 pointsâ.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>files</em> = # of files in set (only for base file, see below)</p></li>
<li><p><em>points</em> = # of points in surface (optional, see below)</p></li>
<li><p><em>lines</em> = # of line segments in surface (only allowed for 2d)</p></li>
<li><p><em>triangles</em> = # of triangles in surface (only allowed for 3d)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>files</em> keyword only appears in the âbaseâ file for a set of
multiple files indicated by the â%â character in the filename. It tells
SPARTA how many additional files exist in the set. A âbaseâ file has no
additional sections, i.e. no body.</p>
<p>The <em>points</em> keyword is optional (see below). For a set of multiple
files, it cannot appear in the âbaseâ file, but only in individual files
in the set.</p>
<p>The <em>points</em>, <em>lines</em>, <em>triangles</em> keywords refer to the number of
points, lines, triangles in an individual file. Except in the case of a
âbaseâ file for a set of multiple files. In that case, the <em>lines</em> and
<em>triangles</em> keywords give the number of lines or triangles in the entire
set.</p>
<p>These are the recognized section keywords for the body of the file.</p>

<li><p><em>Points, Lines, Triangles</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Points</em> section consists of N consecutive entries, where N = # of
points, each of this form:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">index</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">z</span>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">index</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span>      <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The index value is ignored; it is only added to assist in examining the
file. When lines and triangles reference point indices they are simply
ordered from 1 to N, regardless of the actual value of the index in the
file. <em>X,y,z</em> are the coordinates of the point in distance units. Note
that for 2d simulations, <em>z</em> should be omitted.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless points are on the surface of the simulation box,
they will be part of multiple lines or triangles. However, there is no
requirement that each point appear exactly once in the <em>Points</em> list.
For example, a point that is the common corner point of M triangles,
could appear 1 or 2 or up to M times. However, if the same point appears
multiple times in the <em>Points</em> list, the coordinates of all copies must
be numerically identical, in order for SPARTA to verify the surface is a
watertight object, as discussed below.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <em>points</em> keyword and <em>Points</em> section are not
required. You must either use both or neither. As explained next, an
optional format for the <em>Lines</em> or <em>Triangles</em> sections includes point
coordinates directly with each line or triangle.</p>
<p>The <em>Lines</em> section is only allowed for 2d simulations and consists of N
entries, where N = # of lines. All entries must be in the same format,
either A or B. If a Points section was included, use format A. If it was
not, use format B.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">line</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ID</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">p1</span> <span class="n">p2</span>               <span class="c1"># format A</span>
<span class="n">line</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ID</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">p1x</span> <span class="n">p1y</span> <span class="n">p2x</span> <span class="n">p2y</span>     <span class="c1"># format B</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The line-ID is stored internally with the line. If the read_surf
commmand is reading a single file, the line-IDs should be unique values
from 1 to N where N is the number of lines specified in the header of
the file. For a set of multiple files, each line in the collection of
all files should have a unique ID, and the IDs should range from 1 to N,
where N is the number of lines specified in the base file. SPARTA does
not check line-IDs for uniqueness. Note that lines in an individual file
(single or multiple) do not need to be listed by ID order; they can be
in any order.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the read_surf command is used when lines already
exist, i.e. to add new lines, then each line-ID is incremented by
Nprevious = the # of lines that already exist.</p>
<p><em>Type</em> is an optional integer value which must be specified for all or
none of the lines in the file. If used, it must be a positive integer
value for each line. If not specified, the type of each line is set to
1. Line IDs and types can be used to assign lines to surface groups via
the <a class="reference external" href="group.html">group surf</a> command.</p>
<p>For format A, <em>p1</em> and <em>p2</em> are the indices of the 2 end points of the
line segment, as found in the Points section. Each is a value from 1 to
the # of points, as described above. For format B, (p1x,p1y) and
(p2x,p2y) are the (x,y) coordinates of the two points (1,2) in the line.</p>
<p>The ordering of <em>p1</em>, <em>p2</em> is important as it defines the direction of
the outward normal for the line segment when a particle collides with
it. Molecules only collide with the âouterâ edge of a line segment. This
is defined by a right-hand rule. The outward normal N = (0,0,1) x
(p2-p1). In other words, a unit z-direction vector is crossed into the
vector from <em>p1</em> to <em>p2</em> to determine the normal.</p>
<p>The <em>Triangles</em> section is only allowed for 3d simulations and consists
of N entries, where N = # of triangles. All entries must be in the same
format, either A or B. If a Points section was included, use format A.
If it was not, use format B.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">tri</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ID</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">p1</span> <span class="n">p2</span> <span class="n">p3</span>                                  <span class="c1"># format A</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The tri-ID is stored internally with the line. If the read_surf commmand
is reading a single file, the tri-IDs should be unique values from 1 to
N where N is the number of triangles specified in the header of the
file. For a set of multiple files, each triangle in the collection of
all files should have a unique ID, and the IDs should range from 1 to N,
where N is the number of triangles specified in the base file. SPARTA
does not check tri-IDs for uniqueness. Note that triangles in an
individual file (single or multiple) do not need to be listed by ID
order; they can be in any order.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the read_surf command is used when triangles already
exist, i.e. to add new triangles, then each tri-ID is incremented by
Nprevious = the # of triangles that already exist.</p>
<p><em>Type</em> is an optional integer value which must be specified for all or
none of the triangles in the file. If used, it must be a positive
integer value for each triangle. If not specified, the type of each
triangle is set to 1. Triangle IDs and types can be used to assign
triangles to surface groups via the <a class="reference external" href="group.html">group surf</a> command.</p>
<p>For format A, <em>p1</em>, <em>p2</em>, and <em>p3</em> are the indices of the 3 corner
points of the triangle, as found in the Points section. Each is a value
from 1 to the # of points, as described above. For format B,
(p1x,p1y,p1z), (p2x,p2y,p2z), and (p3x,p3y,p3z) are the (x,y,z)
coordinates of the three corner points (1,2,3) of the triangle.</p>
<p>The ordering of <em>p1</em>, <em>p2</em>, <em>p3</em> is important as it defines the
direction of the outward normal for the triangle when a particle
collides with it. Molecules only collide with the âouterâ face of a
triangle. This is defined by a right-hand rule. The outward normal N =
(p2-p1) x (p3-p1). In other words, the edge from <em>p1</em> to <em>p2</em> is crossed
into the edge from <em>p1</em> to <em>p3</em> to determine the normal.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The following optional keywords affect the geometry of the read-in
surface elements. The geometric transformations they describe are
performed in the order they are listed, which gives flexibility in how
surfaces can be manipulated. Note that the order may be important; e.g.
performing an <em>origin</em> operation followed by a <em>rotate</em> operation may
not be the same as a <em>rotate</em> operation followed by an <em>origin</em>
operation.</p>
<p>Most of the keywords perform a geometric transformation on all the
vertices in the surface file with respect to an origin point. By default
the origin is (0.0,0.0,0.0), regardless of the position of individual
vertices in the file.</p>
<p>The <em>origin</em> keyword resets the origin to the specified <em>Ox,Oy,Oz</em>. This
operation has no effect on the vertices.</p>
<p>The <em>trans</em> keyword shifts or displaces the origin by the vector
(Dx,Dy,Dz). It also displaces each vertex by (Dx,Dy,Dz).</p>
<p>The <em>atrans</em> keyword resets the origin to an absolute point (Ax,Ay,Az)
which implies a displacement (Dx,Dy,Dz) from the current origin. It also
displaces each vertex by (Dx,Dy,Dz).</p>
<p>The <em>ftrans</em> keyword resets the origin to a fractional point (Fx,Fy,Fz).
Fractional means that Fx = 0.0 is the lower edge/face in the x-dimension
and Fx = 1.0 is the upper edge/face in the x-dimension, and similarly
for Fy and Fz. This change of origin implies a displacement (Dx,Dy,Dz)
from the current origin. This operation also displaces each vertex by
(Dx,Dy,Dz).</p>
<p>The <em>scale</em> keyword does not change the origin. It computes the
displacement vector of each vertex from the origin (delx,dely,delz) and
scales that vector by (Sx,Sy,Sz), so that the new vertex coordinate is
(Ox + Sx*delx,Oy + Sy*dely,Oz + Sz*delz).</p>
<p>The <em>rotate</em> keyword does not change the origin. It rotates the
coordinates of all vertices by an angle <em>theta</em> in a counter-clockwise
direction, around the vector starting at the origin and pointing in the
direction <em>Rx,Ry,Rz</em>. Any rotation can be represented by an appropriate
choice of origin, <em>theta</em> and (Rx,Ry,Rz).</p>
<p>The <em>transparent</em> keyword flags all the read in surface elements as
transparent, meaning particles pass through them. This is useful for
tallying flow statistics. The <a class="reference external" href="surf_collide.html">surf_collide
transparent</a> command must also be used to assign a
transparent collision model to those the surface elements. The <a class="reference external" href="compute_surf.html">compute
surf</a> command will tally fluxes differently for
transparent surf elements. The <a class="reference external" href="Section_howto.html#howto_15">Section
6.15</a> doc page provides an overview of
transparent surfaces. See those doc pages for details.</p>
<p>The <em>invert</em> keyword does not change the origin or any vertex
coordinates. It flips the direction of the outward surface normal of
each surface element by changing the ordering of its vertices. Since
particles only collide with the outer surface of a surface element, this
is a mechanism for using a surface files containing a single sphere (for
example) as either a sphere to embed in a flow field, or a spherical
outer boundary containing the flow.</p>
<p>The <em>clip</em> keyword does not change the origin. It truncates or âclipsâ a
surface that extends outside the simulation box in the following manner.
In 3d, each of the 6 clip planes represented by faces of the global
simulation box are considered in turn. Any triangle that straddles the
face (with points on both sides of the clip plane), is truncated at the
plane. New points along the edges that cross the plane are created. A
triangle may also become a trapezoid, in which case it turned into 2
triangles. Then all the points on the side of the clip plane that is
outside the box, are projected onto the clip plane. Finally, all
triangles that lie in the clip plane are removed, as are any points that
are unused after the triangle removal. After this operation is repeated
for all 6 faces, the remaining surface is entirely inside the simulation
box, though some of its triangles may include points on the faces of the
simulation box. A similar operation is performed in 2d with the 4 clip
edges represented by the edges of the global simulation box.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: If a surface you clip crosses a periodic boundary, as
specified by the <a class="reference external" href="boundary.html">boundary</a> command, then the clipping
that takes place must be consistent on both the low and high end of the
box (in the periodic dimension). This means any point on the boundary
that is generated by the clip operation should be generated twice, once
on the low side of the box and once on the high side. And those two
points must be periodic images of each other, as implied by periodicity.
If the surface you are reading does not clip in this manner, then SPARTA
will likely generate an error about mis-matched or inconsistent cells
when it attempts to mark all the grid cells and their corner points as
inside vs outside the surface.</p>
<p>If you use the <em>clip</em> keyword, you should check the resulting statistics
of the clipped surface printed out by this command, including the
minimum size of line and triangle edge lengths. It is possible that very
short lines or very small triangles will be created near the box surface
due to the clipping operation, depending on the coordinates of the
initial unclipped points.</p>
<p>If this is the case, an optional <em>fraction</em> argument can be appended to
the <em>clip</em> keyword. <em>Fraction</em> is a unitless value which is converted to
a distance <em>delta</em> in each dimension where delta = fraction * (boxhi -
boxlo). If a point is nearer than delta to the lo or hi boundary in a
dimension, the point is moved to be on the boundary, before the clipping
operation takes place. This can prevent tiny surface elements from being
created due to clipping. If <em>fraction</em> is not specified, the default
value is 0.0, which means points are not moved. If specified, <em>fraction</em>
must be a value between 0.0 and 0.5.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>clip</em> operation may delete some surface elements and
create new ones. Likewise for the points that define the end points or
corner points of surface element lines (2d) or triangles (3d). The
resulting altered set of surface elements can be written out to a file
by the <a class="reference external" href="write_surf.html">write_surf</a> command, which can then be used
an input to a new simulation or for post-processing and visualization.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: When the <em>clip</em> operation deletes or adds surface
elements, the line-IDs or tri-IDs will be renumbered to produce IDs that
are consective values from 1 to the # of surface elements. The ID of a
surface element that is unclipped may change due to this reordering.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The following optional keywords affect group and type settings for the
read-in surface elements and output of the elements. Also how particles
are treated when surface elements are added.</p>
<p>Surface groups are collections of surface elements. Each surface element
belongs to one or more surface groups; all elements belong to the âallâ
group, which is created by default. Surface group IDs are used by other
commands to identify a group of suface elements to operate on. See the
<a class="reference external" href="group.html">group surf</a> command for more details.</p>
<p>Every surface element also stores a <em>type</em> which is a positive integer.
<em>Type</em> values are useful for flagging subsets of elements or different
objects in the surface file. For example, a patch of triangles on a
sphere. Or one sphere out of several that the file contains. Surface
element types can be used to define surface groups. See the <a class="reference external" href="group.html">group
surf</a> command for details.</p>
<p>The <em>group</em> keyword specifies an extra surface <em>group-ID</em> to assign all
the read-in surface elements to. All the read-in elements are assigned
to the âallâ group and to <em>group-ID</em>. If <em>group-ID</em> does not exist, a
new surface group is created. If it does exist the read-in surface
elements are added to that group.</p>
<p>The <em>typeadd</em> keyword defines an <em>Noffset</em> value which is added to the
type of each read-in surface element. The default is Noffset = 0, which
means the read-in type values are not altered. If type values are not
included in the file, they default to 1 for every element, but can still
be altered by the <em>typeadd</em> keyword.</p>
<p>Note that use of the <em>group</em> and <em>typeadd</em> keywords allow the same
surface file to be read multiple times (e.g. with different origins,
tranlations, rotations, etc) to define multiple objects, and assign
their surface elements to different groups or different type values.</p>
<p>The <em>particle</em> keyword determines how particles in the simulation are
affected by the new surface elements. If the setting is <em>none</em>, which is
the default, then no particles can exist in the simulation. If the
setting is <em>check</em>, then particles in grid cells that are inside the new
watertight surface object(s) or in grid cells intersected by the new
surface elements are deleted. This is to insure no particles will end up
inside a surface object, which will typically generate errors when
particles move. If the setting is <em>keep</em> then no particles are deleted.
It is up to you to insure that no particles are inside surface
object(s), else an error may occur later. This setting can be useful if
a <a class="reference external" href="remove_surf.html">remove_surf</a> was used to remove a surface
object, and a new object is being read in, and you know the new object
is smaller than the one it replaced. E.g. for a model of a shrinking or
ablating object.</p>
<p>If the <em>file</em> keyword is used, the surfaces will be written out to the
specified <em>filename</em> immediately after they are read in. The arguments
for this keyword are identical to those used for the
<a class="reference external" href="write_surf.html">write_surf</a> command. This includes a file name with
optional â*â and â%â wildcard characters, as well as its optional
keywords.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <em>file</em> keyword must be the last keyword specified
with the read_isurf command. This is because all the remaining arguments
are passed to the <a class="reference external" href="write_surf.html">write_surf</a> command.</p>
<p>The format for the output file is the same as the one written by the
<a class="reference external" href="write_surf.html">write_surf</a> command, or read by this command. Note
that it can be useful to write out a new surface file after reading one
if clipping was performed; the new file will contain the surface element
altered by clipping and will not contain any surface elements removed by
clipping.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong></p>
<p>This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by the
<a class="reference external" href="create_box.html">create_box</a> command, and after a grid has been
created by the <a class="reference external" href="create_grid.html">create_grid</a> command. If particles
already exist in the simulation, you must insure particles do not end up
inside the added surfaces. See the <em>particle</em> keyword for options with
regard to particles.</p>
<p>To read gzipped surface files, you must compile SPARTA with the
-DSPARTA_GZIP option - see <a class="reference external" href="Section_start.html#start_2">Section 2.2</a>
of the manual for details.</p>
<p>The <em>clip</em> keyword cannot be used when the <a class="reference external" href="global.html">global surfs
explicit/distributed</a> command has been used. This is
because we have not yet figured out how to clip distributed surfaces.</p>
<p>Every vertex in the final surface (after translation, rotation, scaling,
etc) must be inside or on the surface of the global simulation box. Note
that using the <em>clip</em> operation guarantees that this will be the case.</p>
<p>The surface elements in a single surface file must represent a
âwatertightâ surface. For a 2d simulation this means that every point is
part of exactly 2 line segments. For a 3d simulation it means that every
triangle edge is part of exactly 2 triangles. Exceptions to these rules
allow for triangle edges (in 3d) that lie entirely in a global face of
the simulation box, or for line points (in 2d) that are on a global edge
of the simulation box. This can be the case after clipping, which allows
for use of watertight surface object (e.g. a sphere) that is only
partially inside the simulation box, but which when clipped to the box
becomes non-watertight, e.g. half of a sphere.</p>
<p>Note that this definition of watertight does not require that the
surface elements in a file represent a single physical object; multiple
objects (e.g. spheres) can be represented, provided each is watertight.</p>
<p>Another restriction on surfaces is that they do not represent an object
that is âinfinitely thinâ, so that two sides of the same object lie in
the same plane (3d) or on the same line (2d). This will not generate an
error when the surface file is read, assuming the watertight rule is
followed. However when particles collide with the surface, errors will
be generated if a particle hits the âinsideâ of a surface element before
hitting the âoutsideâ of another element. This can occur for infinitely
thin surfaces due to numeric round-off.</p>
<p>When running a simulation with multiple objects, read from one or more
surface files, you should insure they do not touch or overlap with each
other. SPARTA does not check for this, but it will typically lead to
unphysical particle dynamics.</p>
